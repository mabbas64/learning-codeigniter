1- Download CodeIgniter (I got the 4.1.2 version on 5nov2013 first time use).
2- Extract the files to a folder in /htdocs. Create apache VirtualHost ( i did http://ci.dev/) in httpd-vhosts.conf
----- also update the windows hosts file to point to ci.dev in /htdocs/ci-project
3- Add an encryption key in the config.php inside /application folder of our CI project.
4- Create a mysql DB from phpMyAdmin etc, we'll used this in our database.php of CI project.

5- Modifying autload.php 
----Libraries: add 'database', and 'session' libraries to the $autoload['libraries'] array,
------- this'll allow us to use database and sessions on all of our controller
----Helpers: are basically like libraries but there's not as much to them.
------- we'll add the 'url' helper here.
----!---- Its best to add libraries/helpers etc within the controllers if you need those in fewer areas.

6- Adding DB tables for the test project
---- add a 'posts' table from phpMyAdmin  ,with fields > http://i.imgur.com/siarX5V.jpg
---! table names are plural in frameworks

7- Create a Model now.
---- save the file in /models folder of project as 'post.php'. Model names are singular in frameowkrs

8- Create a Controller
---- save a file in /controllers folder of project as 'posts.php'. Controller names are plural
----- Add an index function that fetches db data
------! Notice how the controller matches name of the db table  and 

9- Print the database fetched data temporary by visiting http://ci.dev/index.php/posts
---- in the url above, index.php is the main ci index.php and /posts is our controller 
------- you'll see a blank array (as we dont have the DB tables filled yet) http://i.imgur.com/1tQnWUk.jpg

10- Pouplate DB table 'posts' via PHPmyAdmin.
----- http://i.imgur.com/MQ9ScJu.jpg
------- Visit again http://ci.dev/index.php/posts
--------- In browser you should see:   http://i.imgur.com/Zjfdljy.jpg  (doesn't have the inactive 3rd post)

11- Creating a View
---- create 'post_index.php' in /Views folder. It doesnt need a class, it'll contain all our HTML
--!!-- inside the 'posts' controller, load the view and pass it the $data array there- which has DB data.
