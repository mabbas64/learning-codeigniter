1- Download CodeIgniter (I got the 4.1.2 version on 5nov2013 first time use).
2- Extract the files to a folder in /htdocs. Create apache VirtualHost ( i did http://ci.dev/) in httpd-vhosts.conf
----- also update the windows hosts file to point to ci.dev in /htdocs/ci-project
3- Add an encryption key in the config.php inside /application folder of our CI project.
4- Create a mysql DB from phpMyAdmin etc, we'll used this in our database.php of CI project.

5- Modifying autload.php 
----Libraries: add 'database', and 'session' libraries to the $autoload['libraries'] array,
------- this'll allow us to use database and sessions on all of our controller
---- Helpers: are basically like libraries but there's not as much to them.
------- we'll add the 'url' helper here.
----!---- Its best to add libraries/helpers etc within the controllers if you need those in fewer areas.
